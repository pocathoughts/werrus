              <p class="mb-5">In 2010, after several years of CrossFit training at a local box in Houston, Colin was convinced of the positive effects of this type of fitness regime and transformed his garage into a CrossFit gym. What began as a hobby transformed into a team of athletes dedicated to helping others reach their fitness goals. Originally from El Paso, Colin was a high school athlete and collegiate rower at the University of Texas at Austin. Not only is Colin passionate about the physical aspect of CrossFit, he enjoys the mental aspect and the strength that comes from mind and body alignment. As many will attest, he's also a stickler for perfect form. Outside of exercising (CrossFit, Skiing, Basketball), Colin loves cooking and collegiate football. 

              <br/>
              <br/>

              Colin became a CrossFit Level 1 Trainer in October 2012, a CrossFit Level 2 Trainer in 2013, and holds certificates in CrossFit Kids, and CrossFit Mobility. </p>

              <p class="mb-5">Jeesoung found CrossFit in March of 2012. After 6 years of inactivity, a herniated disc, and weighing the most he ever has, he knew he needed to change his current lifestyle immediately. Even though he threw up after every single WOD for the first week, he kept coming back because of the constantly varied workouts and strong community of support. Watching his weight drop 30 pounds and his deadlift max exceed 400+ pounds, he wanted to share his passion for a strong and healthy lifestyle with everyone he could. He received his CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Certificate in February of 2013 and is looking forward to receiving more certificates in order to increase his knowledge and training abilities. He is also an active council member of Bo's Buddies, loves fishing and hunting, music, and anything outdoors. Proverbs 27:17
              As iron sharpens iron, so a friend sharpens his friend.

After moving back to Texas, she joined Iron Oak CrossFit to continue improving her fitness. Intrigued and fascinated by the program’s focus on strength and performance and the program’s ability to push one out of their comfort zone, Vivien became passionate about CrossFit. She was inspired and moved by the transformations in people both physically and mentally, which prompt her to embark on her coaching journey. Vivien became a CF L-1 Trainer in July 2014 and is always ready to have some fun! Outside CrossFit, Vivien enjoys traveling, being outdoors, fishing, snowboarding, playing guitar, and watching live music. Food makes her happy.

              <p class="mb-5">Born and raised in the burbs outside of Houston, Eric began CrossFit in 2010 by transforming his garage into a box. As a former competitive weightlifter, Eric is passionate about Olympic style weightlifting and helping others achieve their fitness goals. Eric is a graduate of Texas Tech University with a degree in Health and Nutrition. As an avid outdoorsman, you can usually find him near a body of water (chlorine or salt) absorbing too much vitamin D. He loves to cook and describes his diet as "paleo with a healthy dose of Tex-Mex... and BBQ". Obtaining his CrossFit L1 certification in January, and as a USAW Certified Sports Performance Coach, Eric's knowledge and background will be a great resource for anyone wanting to improve their fitness.

              <p class="mb-5">Erica believes CrossFit saved her life. Not in the sense that she was unhealthy and physically needing a change but more like a mental emergency. Like so many, she had lost her passion, and was unchallenged, uninspired, and withdrawing more and more. In January of 2012, she stumbled into her first box and left changed forever. It brought her back to life and led her to becoming a Certified Personal Trainer, a nutrition coach, and a Level 1 CrossFit trainer. A perfect day for Erica would include a meditation, a fresh meal shared with friends, and a spicy metcon. All of which she says require you to be fully present and not take yourself too seriously. She believes that’s the magic of Crossfit. “It reminds you that you already have everything you need to be healthy, happy, and whole, you just have to get out of your own way.”
